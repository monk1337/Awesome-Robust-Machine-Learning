# Awesome-Robust-Machine-Learning

Robust machine learning typically refers to the robustness of machine learning algorithms. For a machine learning algorithm to be considered robust, either the testing error has to be consistent with the training error, or the performance is stable after adding some noise to the dataset. This repo contains a curated list of papers/articles and recent advancements in Robust Machine Learning.
